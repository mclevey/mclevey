## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is John (he/him). Iâ€™m an Associate Professor in Knowledge Integration (an interdiciplinary Arts & Sciences plus program) and Sociology & Legal Studies at the University of Waterloo. I work primarily in the areas of computational social science, network science, and cognitive social science.

My current research addresses three broad and longstanding themes that cut across the social, cognitive, and computational/statistical sciences. First, I am developing generative models of schematic cognition, social influence, and cultural learning to deepen our knowledge of how latent opinions, identities, beliefs, and behaviors form and co-evolve, and to better measure polarization and large-scale cultural change. In developing these models, I am primarily focused on culture related to (a) climate change and environmental policy; (a) harm reduction initiatives and public health responses to the toxic drug supply and overdose crisis; (c) generative artificial intelligence; (d) privacy, security, and surveillance; and (e) lifestyle preferences and politics. Second, I am using these models as digital â€™laboratoriesâ€™ (of a sort) to better understand the workings and impacts of coordinated information operations such as disinformation campaigns and censorship on populations. Third, I am using data from social media platforms to better understand the role of emotional dynamics and identity-related processes in online political discussions. I approach each of these projects as a computational social scientist with expertise in network science and social network analysis, probabilistic and generative modelling, and computational text analysis.
